# Launching the project

After obtaining a copy of the project on your local machine navigate to the installation directory using a terminal application.

Ensure that you have both Java JDK and Maven installed and available on your path.

Run command "mvn spring-boot:run" and the project will launch.

Alternatively, open this project using your favourite IDE and use the built-in tools of said IDE to launch the project.

It is strongly suggested to launch this application first before launching the front end application.
